# DataStructures

A collection of data structure implementations, with operations on them.

## TODOS:

- Heap implementation and basic operations - to test -> DONE: 27/05/2020
- Heap creation from array -> DONE: 27/05/2020
- BST implementation and basic operations
- Trees implementation and basic operations
- Graph MIT videos: 
    * [Graphs introduction and BFS -MIT ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-CYnVz-uh4) -> Revisit
    > Gives a quick summary and introduction on graphs, its various applications, how to represent them and BFS search. Not completely beginner friendly, decent for reference.
    * [DFS on graphs - MIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfSk24UTFS8) -> Revisit

## DOUBTS:

- Karumanchi Page 200 (Heap)
- Bipartite graph, spanning trees, unconnected graphs.
